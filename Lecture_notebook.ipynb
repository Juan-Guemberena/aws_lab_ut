    "This lab examines the difference between IAM vs AWS Resource based policies. In particular, we seek to understand the policy evaluation logic for S3 buckets with cross account access. For a refresher on IAM basics, see [Reference Policies Evaluation Logic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic.html), which is valid for when the IAM Principal and S3 Resource are in the same AWS account.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize the above, if an action is allowed by an identity-based policy, a resource-based policy, or both, then AWS allows the action. An explicit deny in either of these policies overrides the allow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The situation changes for [cross account access](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cross-account-access-s3/). In this case, access must be explicitly allowed in both the principal's AWS access policy and the resource policy. Unfortunately, the latter reference does not mention the confused deputy issue for cross-account access which occurs when the trusted account is a 3rd party SaaS vendor. As a result, many vendors which operate on customer's S3 buckets do so insecurely.\n",
